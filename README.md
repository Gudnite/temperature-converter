Start web API by setting it as the start up project.

Get the URL which it is beeing hosted and replace the base url according to fectch the converted data from the API

In ortder run the Angular Web APP clone the repo and proceed with npm install and npm start.

PS : Didnt add Authentication bearer token for the API because it is POC level implementations. Minimum level MVP product is being implemented.

Note that that I havent hosted the API anywhere as I have ran out of free tier access of cloud service providers. Please refer to the API implmentation accordingly or ping
me up to get the API up and running accordingly.
